# IOT_based_Smart_Irrigation
To take part in the Project Expo that was held to celebrate Engineer's day we (my teammate and I) developed an IOT based smart irrigation system that turns the water pump on and off based on the atmospheric temperature, humidity, and the soil moisture in the farm. This real-time data is also posted on thingspeak.com website, so that we can check on the farming conditions remotely from anywhere.
